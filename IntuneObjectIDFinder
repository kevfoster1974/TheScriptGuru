.SYNOPSIS
    I've always had issues obtaining the object ID's for devices within Intune for bulk uploads, many times I would get multiple ID's for the same asset
    This script only obatins the ID's for the most recent syync device/ID alongside the users email.
     
.DESCRIPTION
    Same as above
